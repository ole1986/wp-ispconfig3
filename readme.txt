ISPConfig 3 form generation using Gutenberg Blocks incl. WooCommerce support and individual shortcode creation

== Description ==

The WP ISPConfig 3 plugin allows you to build customer forms for [ISPConfig3](http://www.ispconfig.org) clients, websites, shell accounts and others using the ISPConfig3 REST API.
With the new **Gutenberg Block support** this plugin provides several default templates.

* Create client accounts
* Create websites
* Create databases
* Update client information
* Update client bank details
* Wizard integration

To extend this plugin [action/filter hooks](https://github.com/ole1986/wp-ispconfig3/wiki/Use-wp-ispconfig3-action-and-filter-hooks) can be used.
For complex solutions and access to the ISPConfig3 REST API an [extension plugin](https://github.com/ole1986/wp-ispconfig3/wiki/Extension-plugins) may be more relevent

Check out the [wiki pages on github.com](https://github.com/ole1986/wp-ispconfig3/wiki) for further details

**For WooCommerce integration, please install [WC Recurring Invoice PDF](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc-invoice-pdf/)**

* You will need to first create a Remote User account in your ISPConfig Control Panel under the System tab. This user will need all permissions.
* Make sure to choose/create/generate a very secure password. This user account allows full access to your Control Panel REST API.

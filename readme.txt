ISPConfig 3 ~ Hosting Control Panel ~ registration form interface incl. invoice module and product management for WooCommerce

== Description ==

The WP ISPConfig 3 plugin allows you to frontend/customer registration forms to create clients, websites, shell users directly into the [ISPConfig](http://www.ispconfig.org) Control Panel by using its REST API.

**ISPCONFIG Features**

* shipped with two default registration form for websites (ispconfig_register_client / ispconfig_register_free)
* use the shortcode "[ispconfig class=IspconfigRegisterClient]" and "[ispconfig class=IspconfigRegisterFree]" to display the forms at any place
* display domains and databases filtered by user
* build your own forms (incl. shortcodde) in less than 5 minutes (Check out the Installation section for more details)

Check out the Installation tab for more details on how to build your own extension

**FOR RECURRING INVOICES USE THE [WC Recurring Invoice PDF](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc-invoice-pdf/) PLUGIN**

== Installation ==

* Search for "wp-ispconfig3" in the "Plugins -> Install" register
* Press Install followed by activate
* Setup the plugin as mentioned below in the Configuration section 

**Configuration**

It is required to configure the plugin in the ISPConfig Panel as well as in the plugin settings (wordpress).

= ISPConfig3 Control panel =

* Open the ISPConfig Control Panel with your favorite browser and login as administrator.
* Navigate to `System -> User Management -> Remote User`
* Add a new remote user with a secure password

= Plugin settings =

* Log into your wordpress page as administrator and switch to the backend
* Active the plugin (if not done yet)
* Open `WP-ISPConfig 3 -> Settings` from the backend
* Fill in ISPConfig information as following (replace localhost with the host the REST API is running)

`SOAP Username: remoteuser`
`SOAP Password: remoteuserpass`
`SOAP Location: http://localhost:8080/remote/index.php`
`SOAP URI: http://localhost:8080/remote/`

**Customize the plugin**

You can extend the plugin with your own registration form by using PHP only inside the plugin folder (E.g. wp-content/plugins/wp-ispconfig3/).

**PLEASE NOTE:** BACKUP YOUR EXTENSION FILE(S) BEFORE UPDATING THE PLUGIN

*A general knowledge about PHP and OOP is recommended*

The simpliest way to build your on registration form is to copy one of the existing shortcode classes (either "ispconfig_register_client.php" or "ispconfig_register_free.php").
In this examples we will use the "ispconfig_register_client.php".

* Copy the "ispconfig_register_client.php" into "ispconfig_register_custom.php"
* Open the "ispconfig_register_custom.php" and rename the class name in line 8 to "IspconfigRegisterCustom"
* Replace or amend the method "Display($opt = null)" with your needs
* Replace or amend the method "onPost()" to manage the page post request
* Place a page using the shortcode "[ispconfig class=IspconfigRegisterCustom]" to display the form

Below is a minimal version to register a client user with a website.


`
class IspconfigRegisterCustom extends Ispconfig {
    /**
     * Called when user submits the data from register form - see Ispconfig::Display() for more details
     */
    protected function onPost(){
        if ( 'POST' !== $_SERVER[ 'REQUEST_METHOD' ] ) return;
        
        $opt = ['username' => $_POST['username'], 'password' => $_POST['password'], 'domain'   => $_POST['domain']];

        try{
            $client = $this->withSoap();
            // check if the client name already exist in ISPConfig           
            $client = $this->GetClientByUser($opt['username']);
            if(!empty($client)) throw new Exception('The user already exist. Please choice a different name');

            // add the customer
            $this->AddClient($opt)
                            ->AddWebsite( ['domain' => $opt['domain'], 'password' => $opt['password']] );
            
            echo "<div class='ispconfig-msg ispconfig-msg-success'>" . sprintf(__('Your account %s has been created', 'wp-ispconfig3'), $opt['username']) ."</div>";

            $this->closeSoap();
        } catch (SoapFault $e) {
            //WPISPConfig3::soap->__getLastResponse();
            echo '<div class="ispconfig-msg ispconfig-msg-error">SOAP Error: '.$e->getMessage() .'</div>';
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            echo '<div class="ispconfig-msg ispconfig-msg-error">Exception: '.$e->getMessage() . "</div>";
        }
    }
    
    /**
     * Use the shortcode "[ispconfig class=IspconfigRegisterCustom]" to display the form
     */
    public function Display($opt = null){
        
        ?>
        <div class="wrap">
            <?php $this->onPost(); ?>
            <form method="post" class="ispconfig" action="">
            <?php
                WPISPConfig3::getField('username', 'User:', 'text', ['container' => 'div']);
                WPISPConfig3::getField('password', 'Pass:', 'text', ['container' => 'div']);
                WPISPConfig3::getField('domain', 'Domain:', 'text', ['container' => 'div']);
            ?>
            <p><input type="submit" class="button-primary" name="submit" value="Submit" /></p>
            </form>
        </div>
        <?php
    }
}
